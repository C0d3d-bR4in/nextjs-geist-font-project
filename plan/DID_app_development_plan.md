# Decentralized Identity Management (DID) App Development Plan

## Information Gathered
- User wants a DID app for university final year project.
- Technologies: Hyperledger Fabric blockchain, Node.js backend, IPFS for file storage, Docker for containerization.
- User environment: Linux (Parrot OS) with Hyperledger, IPFS, Docker, Node.js installed.
- Project currently a Next.js frontend with many UI components but no backend or blockchain integration.
- Features:
  - Users upload personal documents (passport, driving license, NID, etc.)
  - Verifier manually approves documents and stores approval on Hyperledger blockchain
  - Users can verify identity via unique ID through API for third-party websites

## Detailed Code Update Plan

### Frontend (Next.js in `src/app` and `src/components`)
- Create pages:
  - `/upload` - User document upload form with file inputs and metadata
  - `/verifier` - Verifier dashboard to view pending documents, approve/reject
  - `/verify` - Public verification page to check identity by unique ID
- Components:
  - Document upload form component
  - Document list and approval UI for verifier
  - Verification result display component
- Use existing UI components from `src/components/ui` for consistent styling
- Use Google Fonts and Tailwind CSS for modern, clean UI

### Backend (Node.js API routes in `src/pages/api` or `src/app/api`)
- API endpoints:
  - `POST /api/upload` - Accept user document uploads, store files on IPFS, save metadata in temporary DB or cache
  - `GET /api/documents/pending` - Verifier fetches list of pending documents
  - `POST /api/documents/approve` - Verifier approves document, triggers storing hash and metadata on Hyperledger blockchain
  - `GET /api/verify/:id` - Public API to verify identity by unique ID, fetch data from blockchain
    - This API will be used by third-party organizations (e.g., banks, universities) to verify user identity by unique ID without requiring users to upload data repeatedly.
    - Third parties can securely fetch and verify user identity data via this API.
- Middleware for authentication and role-based access (user, verifier, third-party)
- Integration with IPFS client to upload files and get content hashes
- Integration with Hyperledger Fabric SDK to submit transactions for storing approved document hashes and identity info

### Blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric)
- Use existing Hyperledger Fabric network (assumed running via Docker)
- Define chaincode (smart contract) for:
  - Storing document hashes and metadata linked to user unique ID
  - Querying identity data by unique ID
- Chaincode deployment and interaction via Node.js SDK

### IPFS Integration
- Use IPFS HTTP client in backend to upload documents
- Store returned IPFS hashes in blockchain metadata

### Docker
- Use Docker to run Hyperledger Fabric network if not already running
- Optionally containerize backend API for easier deployment

### Security and Roles
- User role: upload documents, view status
- Verifier role: view pending documents, approve/reject
- API authentication (JWT or session-based)
- Data privacy: store only hashes on blockchain, files on IPFS

## Dependent Files to be Created/Edited
- Frontend pages and components under `src/app` and `src/components`
- Backend API routes under `src/app/api` or `src/pages/api`
- Chaincode files for Hyperledger Fabric (outside current Next.js project, but instructions provided)
- Docker compose or scripts for running Fabric network (if needed)
- Utility modules for IPFS and blockchain interaction under `src/lib`

## Follow-up Steps
- Implement frontend UI and backend API incrementally
- Test IPFS upload and retrieval
- Test Hyperledger Fabric chaincode deployment and transactions
- Integrate frontend with backend APIs
- Test full user flow: upload -> verify -> approve -> blockchain storage -> public verification
- Prepare documentation and deployment instructions

Please review this plan and let me know if you approve or want any modifications before I start implementation.
